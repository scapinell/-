# diary
It was originally "Hypernews" project from hyperskill platform, but in the end I thought that it more looks like a diary. To launch it go to hypernews and run "python manage.py runserver" in cmd. Then go to http://localhost:8000/ in browser and enjoy.
Note: refactoring is strictly required. And I plan to add some new functionalities someday.
